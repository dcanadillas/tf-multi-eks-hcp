To use this module, you would need to define the region, cluster_names, node_group_desired_capacity, and node_group_instance_type input variables in your Terraform configuration file. You would also need to provide a list of subnet IDs for each cluster's VPC configuration, an SSH key name for remote access to the worker nodes, and a security group ID for the worker nodes. Here's an example of how you might define these variables:

```
module "eks_clusters" {
  source = "./modules/eks_clusters"

  region                    = "us-west-2"
  cluster_names             = ["cluster-1", "cluster-2", "cluster-3"]
  node_group_desired_capacity = 3
  node_group_instance_type  = "t3.small"
  subnet_ids                = ["subnet-
```
